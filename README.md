👋 Hi there, I’m Elissa!  

🚀 Full-Stack Software Engineer | Creative Problem-Solver | Lifelong Learner

💪 Strengths  
Adaptability • Creative Thinking • Problem Solving • Communication • Client-Focused Mindset • Attention to Detail • Resilience • Growth-Oriented

🏆 Recent Accomplishment  
Completed TripleTen’s Software Engineering program, developing full-stack projects that demonstrated proficiency in JavaScript, React, Node.js, and REST APIs. Delivered responsive, maintainable applications while solving practical coding challenges.

🔎 What Drives Me  
I’m fueled by curiosity and a passion for continuous learning. Whether I’m debugging an issue, writing scalable code, or improving user experience, I bring focus and determination to everything I build.

⚡ Fun Fact  
Early in my coding journey, I thought Git commits were only for when a project was completely finished… so if my early Git history looks suspiciously bare, now you know why! 😅 (Lesson learned—and I commit regularly now!)

💻 Why Software Engineering?  
For me, software engineering isn’t just a career change—it’s the perfect next step in a lifelong pattern of learning, adapting, and building solutions that make people’s lives easier.
