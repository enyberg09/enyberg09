👋 Hi there, I’m Elissa!  

🚀 Aspiring Full-Stack Software Engineer | Creative Problem-Solver | Lifelong Learner

💪 Strengths  
Adaptability • Creative Thinking • Problem Solving • Communication • Client-Focused Mindset • Attention to Detail • Resilience • Growth-Oriented

🌱 Current Focus  
I’m currently enrolled at TripleTen’s Software Engineering program, diving deep into full-stack development and writing clean, maintainable code. I love the constant learning, the puzzle-solving nature of coding, and the ability to blend logic with creativity.

🔎 What Drives Me  
I’m fueled by curiosity and a passion for continuous learning. Whether I’m debugging an issue, writing scalable code, or improving user experience, I bring focus and determination to everything I build.

⚡ Fun Fact  
Early in my coding journey, I thought Git commits were only for when a project was completely finished… so if my early Git history looks suspiciously bare, now you know why! 😅 (Lesson learned—and I commit regularly now!)

💻 Why Software Engineering?  
For me, software engineering isn’t just a career change—it’s the perfect next step in a lifelong pattern of learning, adapting, and building solutions that make people’s lives easier.

📈 Looking Ahead  
I’m excited to contribute to innovative teams, keep growing as a developer, and help create tech that’s both functional and user-friendly.
